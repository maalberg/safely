## About

_Safely_ is currently a playground to learn and demonstrate what can be achieved when stability notions from the theory of automatic control meet the expressiveness and flexibility of machine learning.
_Safely_ stands for _safe Lyapunov_, where _Lyapunov_ refers to the Lyapunov stability theory, named after a Russian mathematician and engineer Aleksandr Lyapunov who laid the foundations of this theory.

The current work is inspired by the following publications:

1. [Safe Learning of Regions of Attraction for Uncertain, Nonlinear Systems with Gaussian Processes](https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2016.7798979)
2. [Safe Model-based Reinforcement Learning with Stability Guarantees](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/766ebcd59621e305170616ba3d3dac32-Paper.pdf)
